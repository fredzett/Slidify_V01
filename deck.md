## What is Bayes' Rule? 
    

- Bayes Rule states that the probability of an event $A$ given evidence $B$ is:
  $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$
  
- Here, $P(A|B)$ is the **posterior** probability, $P(B|A)$ is the **likelihood**, $P(A)$ is the **prior** probability, and $P(B)$ is the **normalizing constant**.
  
- Bayes Rule can be used to update prior beliefs with new evidence.
